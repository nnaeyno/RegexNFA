# RegexNFA
This project focuses on converting regular expressions into Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFA) and simulating the behavior of the resulting NFA for pattern matching and string recognition.

## Overview
Regular expressions are powerful tools for defining patterns in strings. This project aims to demonstrate the process of converting regular expressions into NFA and then using the NFA to simulate pattern matching on input strings.

## Features
* Regular Expression Parser: Parses input regular expressions and converts them into an intermediate representation suitable for NFA generation.
* NFA Generator: Generates NFA from the intermediate representation of regular expressions.

* NFA Simulator: Simulates the behavior of the generated NFA on input strings to determine if they match the specified pattern.
